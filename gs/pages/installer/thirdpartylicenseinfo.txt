1. GRANT OF LICENSE.

This is a license agreement, and NOT an agreement for sale. ComponentArt retains ownership of the copy of THE SOFTWARE in your possession, and all copies you may be licensed to make. ComponentArt retains all rights not expressly granted to you in this LICENSE. ComponentArt hereby grants to you, and you accept, a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, copy and modify THE SOFTWARE only as authorized below. 

Provided that you have accepted these terms contained herein by clicking the "YES" button at the end of this Agreement, this EULA grants you the following rights: 

Installation and Use: 

DEVELOPER LICENSE: For single-version licenses, you are granted a license as a single developer (individual) to the particular licensed version of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT. For subscription-based licenses, you are granted a license as a single developer (individual) to all versions of the particular product released during the period of the subscription.

For the version(s) you are licensed for, you are granted a license as a single individual to distribute the SOFTWARE PRODUCT royalty-free with an unlimited number of different solutions to an unlimited number of web servers, provided they are developed solely by you.  The term "different solutions" is understood to mean non-identical, non-"shrink-wrapped" applications to be resold or re-licensed by you.  You may not distribute the product with more than 10 copies of an identical or similarly-functioning ("shrink-wrapped") solution or application.  For royalty-free distribution of more than 10 identical or similarly-functioning copies of a solution or application, you must purchase a subscription-level license or higher, and are required to modify the SOFTWARE PRODUCT code as per ComponentArt's instructions.

At no time may the SOFTWARE PRODUCT be used by more than one individual at the same time for development purposes -- nor may the SOFTWARE PRODUCT be distributed for use with applications other than those developed by you.

For subscription-based licenses, you are further licensed as a single individual to distribute the SOFTWARE PRODUCT royalty-free with an unlimited number of solutions or applications to an unlimited number of web servers, provided they are developed solely by you.  This includes royalty-free distribution of multiple copies of identical or similarly-functioning ("shrink-wrapped") solutions or applications.  For royalty-free distribution of more than 10 identical or similarly-functioning copies of a solution or application, you are required to modify the SOFTWARE PRODUCT code as per ComponentArt's instructions to ensure it cannot be re-used for any purpose outside of your distributed application.

For subscription-based licenses, you are also further licensed to view the source code to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or part thereof, as permitted by the licensor, and modify it for your own needs. You may only re-distribute the source code as part of a compiled solution that adds significant functionality to THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT, and may not redistribute it in non-compiled form.

For Developer and Subscription-based licenses, you are required to reasonably ensure that the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is not reused by or with any application other than those with which you distribute it. For example, if you install the Menu for ASP.NET control along with a packaged application on a customer's server, that customer is not permitted to use the control independent of your application, and must be informed as such.

The royalty-free distribution rights defined above are not applicable to applications developed for Microsoft SharePoint platform. Special server-based licenses must be acquired from ComponentArt for all SharePoint-based applications distributing the software product.

FOR ALL LICENSES: In no case shall you rent, lease, lend, redistribute nor re-license THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT or any related source code to a 3rd party individual or entity, except as outlined above. In no case shall you grant further redistribution rights for THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT to the end-users of your solution.
